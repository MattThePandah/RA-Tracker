This folder archives older utility scripts preserved for reference:

- enrich-metadata.js: Enrich an entire games file with publisher/year via IGDB.
- diff-games.js: Compute new games between old and new dumps.
- merge-games.js: Merge new games into an existing list.

Prefer using:
- build-library.js: end-to-end covers + metadata + prefetch.
- update-new-games.js: detect new games and update with covers + metadata.
